Preheat your oven to 180C/160C.


Melt your Butter, add in the sugar. Whisk together for until the sugar has dissolved somewhat. Add the egg and the vanilla essence and mix well again.


Sift in the flour, bicarbonate, cocoa powder and add chocolate chips and mix well until it comes together to form a lovely thick cookie dough!


Divide the mixture into 2 Creme Brulee Dishes - but if you dont have any then you can use small foil trays as well!


Place the cookie dough in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until dry on top and just cooked through in the middle - the gooier the better!


Remove from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes and then serve witha giant dollop of ice cream!!
